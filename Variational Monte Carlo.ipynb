    "Quantum Monte Carlo methods were originally developed to solve the Schrödinger equation for many-body systems, which cannot be exactly solved by numerical means. While for simple systems, such as the Hydrogen atom, exact solutions can be calculated, the interaction terms prevent closed solutions for systems with more electrons starting with simple systems like the Helium atom. While mean-field approaches present one solution to the problem, a better way would be to calculate the particle-interations. QMC methods rely on Monte Carlo methods for integration to solve the high-dimensional integrals present in calculations of many-body systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Different approaches exist to apply Monte Carlo thechniques to quantum systems, here we discuss methods find the ground state wave function of a quantum systems. The *variational Monte Carlo* (VMC) approach uses a trial function with adjustable parameters to model the ground state wave function, optimizing the parameters with a Metropolis algorithm and calculating the integrals using Monte Carlo methods. The *diffusion Monte Carlo* (DMC) approach transforms the Schrödinger equation via imaginary time propagation into a diffusion equation, using a classical diffusion process and monte carlo walkers to calculate quantum mechanical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum Monte Carlo methods retrieve a wave function, the ground wave function, based on minimizing the energy as the optimization criterion. Thus, both algorithms are in principle suited for optimization purposes. The feasibility of applying VMC and DMC approaches to general optimization problems is investigated in the last part of this section."
